# Simple Todo Project in Solidity

This projects demonstrates a simple todo application with Web3 features. In general, our traditional Todo application(web2) is to track our work. But here, If you complete the task and if it is approved by the task maker, then you will get rewards in Ether. For example, parents can give their children tasks and encourage them by giving them small rewards when they complete it. If they didn't complete the task, then parents can withdraw the given ether from smart contract. 

This is my inital project in web3. I am finiding ways to convert the web 2 application with web3 featues. In general, Simple Todo application with Payment gateway. Sounds Intresting Huh!!!!!
